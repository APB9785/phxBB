## phxBB

phxBB is a re-imagining of classic message board software such as phpBB and   
vBulletin. It uses a single Phoenix LiveView process to establish a persistent   
connection with each user, providing virtually instantaneous navigation and   
interaction without any full page reloads after the user is logged in.
